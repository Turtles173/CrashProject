# project_1 - Victorian Road Crashes

This is my portion of our first team project in the Monash Data Analytics Bootcamp (2021).  This project we analysed road craches in Victoria, Australia from 2013-2019 to see what might be the most effective preventative measures.  My role was to look at what demographic factors may be in play and if any targeted spending could be done at a local government authority area.
